## Warning!
**This version runs on a outdated python version: Python 3.6.11. This happens as some libraries used are also outdated and need an older version of python. A solution might involve creating a Conda environment.**

## **Introduction**

This one is a chatbot based on a [previously developed work](https://github.com/Abonia1/Seq2Seq-Chatbot) built with tensorflow. This work revolved around portuguese trainning data, hence the whole human-machine interactions are written in this language. However, any material in other tongues can be used in this project.

For this portuguese (PT) version the open source material from the platform (Opus)[https://opus.nlpl.eu/]. The material downloaded was a translated movie subtitles corpora. The bulk contained .xml files with the lines and other info in each.

2. Upload the desired .json files to dataset (testing and preparation there is a .xml to .json converter)
